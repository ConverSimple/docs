Your agent can react to events that occur during the conversation lifecycle. This is done by implementing callback methods in your agent class.

Here are the available callback methods:

- `on_conversation_started(conversation_id: str)`
- `on_conversation_ended(conversation_id: str)`
- `on_tool_called(tool_call)`
- `on_tool_completed(call_id, result)`
- `on_error(error_type: str, message: str, details: dict)`

Here is an example of an agent with event callbacks:

```python
class MyAgent(ConversimpleAgent):
    def on_conversation_started(self, conversation_id: str):
        print(f"🎤 Conversation started: {conversation_id}")
    
    def on_conversation_ended(self, conversation_id: str):
        print(f"📞 Conversation ended: {conversation_id}")
    
    def on_tool_called(self, tool_call):
        print(f"🔧 Executing tool: {tool_call.tool_name}")
    
    def on_error(self, error_type: str, message: str, details: dict):
        print(f"❌ Error ({error_type}): {message}")
```

You can use these callbacks to manage state, log events, or perform any other actions in response to the conversation's progress.
