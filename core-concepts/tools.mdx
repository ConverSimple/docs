description: "Define and register tools for your agent."

Tools are functions that your agent can execute during a conversation. You can define tools to interact with external services, databases, or any other APIs.

## Decorators

The Conversimple SDK provides two decorators for registering tools:

- `@tool`: For synchronous functions.
- `@tool_async`: For asynchronous (async/await) functions.

Here is an example of a class with both a sync and an async tool:

```python
from conversimple import tool, tool_async

class BusinessAgent(ConversimpleAgent):
    @tool("Look up customer information")
    def lookup_customer(self, customer_id: str) -> dict:
        # Synchronous tool execution
        return customer_database.get(customer_id)
    
    @tool_async("Send email notification")
    async def send_email(self, email: str, subject: str, body: str) -> dict:
        # Asynchronous tool execution
        result = await email_service.send(email, subject, body)
        return {"sent": True, "message_id": result.id}
```

## Type Hinting

The SDK automatically generates a JSON schema for your tools based on Python type hints. This allows the Conversimple platform to understand the parameters your tools expect.

The following types are supported:

- `str`
- `int`
- `float`
- `bool`
- `list`
- `dict`
- `Optional[T]`
