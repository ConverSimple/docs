## Overview

Conversimple is a multi-tenant conversational AI platform that provides real-time voice conversation infrastructure for building AI-powered voice agents. The platform separates media processing from customer agentic workflows, allowing you to focus on building intelligent conversation logic while Conversimple handles the complex WebRTC infrastructure, audio processing, and conversation management.

## Architecture Philosophy

Conversimple follows a clean separation of concerns:

### Platform Responsibilities
- **Media Processing**: WebRTC communication, audio transcoding, and streaming
- **Conversation Management**: Lifecycle management, state tracking, and fault tolerance
- **Infrastructure**: Scaling, load balancing, and reliability

### Your Responsibilities
- **Business Logic**: Define what your AI agent can do and how it responds
- **Tool Implementation**: Create functions for accessing your data and services
- **Workflow Design**: Design conversation flows for your specific use case

This separation allows you to:
- Deploy custom agentic workflows without managing infrastructure
- Focus on conversation logic rather than media processing
- Scale effortlessly as your traffic grows
- Maintain full control over your business logic

## How It Works

```mermaid

    A[User Browser] --> B[Conversimple Platform]
    B --> C[Your Agent]
    C --> B
    B --> A

    B -.->|WebRTC Media| D[Audio Processing]
    B -.->|Function Calls| C
    C -.->|Tool Results| B
```

1. **Users** connect via their web browser using WebRTC
2. **Conversimple Platform** manages the media connection and conversation state
3. **Your Agent** receives function calls and returns results
4. **Platform** coordinates with AI providers (STT, LLM, TTS) and routes audio

## Who Should Use Conversimple?

Conversimple is ideal for:

- **Product Teams** building voice-enabled applications without WebRTC expertise
- **Developers** who want to focus on conversation logic rather than infrastructure
- **Businesses** needing scalable voice AI without managing media servers
- **Enterprises** requiring multi-tenant voice conversation capabilities
