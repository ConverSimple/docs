The `ConversimpleAgent` provides several callback methods that you can override in your agent class to react to different events during a conversation.

## Callback Methods

### `on_conversation_started(conversation_id: str)`

Called when a new conversation starts.

```python
def on_conversation_started(self, conversation_id: str) -> None:
    print(f"Conversation started: {conversation_id}")
```

<ParamField path="conversation_id" type="str" required>
  The unique identifier for the started conversation.
</ParamField>

### `on_conversation_ended(conversation_id: str)`

Called when a conversation ends.

```python
def on_conversation_ended(self, conversation_id: str) -> None:
    print(f"Conversation ended: {conversation_id}")
```

<ParamField path="conversation_id" type="str" required>
  The unique identifier for the ended conversation.
</ParamField>

### `on_tool_called(tool_call)`

Called when the platform requests your agent to execute a tool.

```python
def on_tool_called(self, tool_call) -> None:
    print(f"Executing tool: {tool_call.tool_name}")
```

<ParamField path="tool_call" type="conversimple.tools.ToolCall" required>
  An object containing details about the tool call, including `call_id`, `tool_name`, `arguments`, and `conversation_id`.
</ParamField>

### `on_tool_completed(call_id: str, result: Any)`

Called after a tool execution has successfully completed and its result has been sent to the platform.

```python
def on_tool_completed(self, call_id: str, result: Any) -> None:
    print(f"Tool {call_id} completed with result: {result}")
```

<ParamField path="call_id" type="str" required>
  The unique identifier of the tool call.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="result" type="Any" required>

### `on_error(error_type: str, message: str, details: dict)`

Called when an error occurs within the agent or is reported by the platform.

```python

    print(f"Error ({error_type}): {message}")
